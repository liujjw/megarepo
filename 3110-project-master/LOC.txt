We imported Prof. Foster's interpreter lecture  
demo code as a starting point; this cloc'ed 
in at 108 lines of non-comment code. The (total LOC - 108) is our net LOC for 
which we claim full credit.

All accredidations: 

Starter code for calculator: Lecture 16-18 demo code 

parser.mly : support for parsing nested lists was learned from 
https://dev.realworldocaml.org/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html

arrayMatrix.ml : pseudocode for row reduction algorithm was learned from 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination

Pseudocode and starter implementation for row reduction also adapted from
