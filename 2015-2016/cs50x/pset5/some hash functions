        Multiplication Method (Cormen). Choose SIZE to be a power of 2. Let A be some random-looking real number. Knuth suggests 
        SIZE = 0.5*(sqrt(5) - 1) [1 less than the golden ratio]. Then do the following:

        s = k*golden ratio
        x = fractional part of s
        h(k) = floor(SIZE*x)
        This seems to be the method that the theoreticians like.

        To do this quickly with integer arithmetic, let w be the number of bits in a word (e.g. 32) and suppose SIZE is 2^p. Then compute:

        s = floor(A * 2^w)
        x = k*s
        h(k) = x >> (w-p)      // i.e. right shift x by (w-p) bits
        // i.e. extract the p most significant 
        // bits from x
